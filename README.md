# Super Mario War PS3 [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/blckbearx/SMW-ps3)](https://github.com/blckbearx/SMW-ps3/releases/latest)

Super Mario War game for the PS3.

[The original port by lachrymose can be found here.](https://gamebrew.org/images/1/18/SuperMarioWar_R2.zip)

## Prerequisites for compiling

What you'll need:

* The [PS3 Toolchain](https://github.com/ps3dev/ps3toolchain) compiled for your OS (I use [PSDK3v2](https://github.com/Estwald/PSDK3v2) precompiled for Windows, which already includes PSL1GHT and PS3 Libraries).
* [PSL1GHT Libraries](https://github.com/ps3dev/PSL1GHT)
* [PS3 Libraries](https://github.com/ps3dev/ps3libraries)
* In case you're using the pre-compiled PSDK3v2 on Windows you'll also need libvorbis (provided as a zip in this repo, open the zip file and extract the folder next to the PSDK3v2 folder to merge them).

## Installing on PS3

Just download the PKG file and install on the PS3 via Package Manager.
