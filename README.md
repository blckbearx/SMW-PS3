# Super Mario War PS3 [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/blckbearx/SMW-ps3)](https://github.com/blckbearx/SMW-ps3/releases/latest)

Super Mario War game for the PS3.

[The original port by lachrymose can be found here.](https://gamebrew.org/images/1/18/SuperMarioWar_R2.zip)

## Prerequisites for compiling

What you'll need:

* A working PS3 SDK (I use [PSDK3v2](https://github.com/Estwald/PSDK3v2) on Windows).
* You'll also need to add libvorbis (provided as a zip in this repo, open the zip file and extract the folder nexto the PSDK3v2 folder to merge them).

## Installing on PS3

Just download the PKG file and install on the PS3 via Package Manager.
